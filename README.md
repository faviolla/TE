# Tehnoezh

Create new folder for project and open terminal
```bash
$ git clone git@gitlab.turumburum.com:turumburum/tehnoezh.git
$ cd tehnoezh
```

To use Gulp you need to have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed on your system.

Install the dependencies by running:
```bash
$ npm install
```
This creates `node_modules` directory with all the plugins in the root of project.

Run the gulp command in your project directory:
```bash
$ gulp
```
You should now have folder `build` in project root `tehnoezh`.
 
Navigate to `localhost:9000` in browser and you should see `index.html` open, as the server runs in the background.
